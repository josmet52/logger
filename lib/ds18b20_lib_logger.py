"""
   Much of this code is lifted from Adafruit web site
   This class can be used to access one or more DS18B20 temperature sensors
   It uses OS supplied drivers and one wire support must be enabled
   
   To do this add the line dtoverlay=w1-gpio to the end of /boot/config.txt
   
   The DS18B20 has three pins, looking at the flat side with the pins pointing
   down pin 1 is on the left
   connect pin 1 to GPIO ground
   connect pin 2 to GPIO 4 *and* GPIO 3.3V via a 4k8 (4800 ohm) pullup resistor
   connect pin 3 to GPIO 3.3V
   You can connect more than one sensor to the same set of pins
   Only one pullup resistor is required
